# Lab 17: Template Creation using Packer

Duration: 30 minutes

### Creating a Packer Image

To build an image packer utilizes a JSON file with the following sections...

##### [Builders](https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/index.html) (required)
* responsible for creating machines and generating images from them for various platforms.
* You can have multiple builder types in one file.

Below is an example of a basic builder for AWS EBS AMI.
Create a new json file called `web-vistors.pkr.hcl` with the following builder.

```hcl
variable "aws_source_ami" {
  type    = string
  default = "ami-0dd76f917833aac4b"
}

locals { timestamp = regex_replace(timestamp(), "[- TZ:]", "") }

source "amazon-ebs" "autogenerated_1" {
  ami_name      = "tmp-${local.timestamp}"
  instance_type = "t3.small"
  region        = "us-east-1"
  source_ami    = "${var.aws_source_ami}"
  ssh_pty       = "true"
  ssh_username  = "ubuntu"
  subnet_id     = "subnet-07fd2d3a304d98514"
  tags = {
    Created-by = "Packer"
    OS_Version = "Ubuntu"
    Release    = "Latest"
  }
}

build {
  sources = ["source.amazon-ebs.autogenerated_1"]

  provisioner "shell" {
    inline = ["mkdir ~/src", "cd ~/src", "git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/demo-terraform-101.git", "cp -R ~/src/demo-terraform-101/assets /tmp", "sudo sh /tmp/assets/setup-web.sh"]
  }

}
```

##### [Variables](https://www.packer.io/docs/templates/user-variables.html)
* User variables allow your templates to be further configured with variables from the command-line, environment variables, Vault, or files.
    * **Note**: these can be definied within the main JSON file and also be passed from an additional variable file, we will cover how to pass those variables further below
    
    
##### [Provisioners](https://www.packer.io/docs/provisioners/index.html)
* use builtin and third-party software to install and configure the machine image after booting. Provisioners prepare the system for use, so common use cases for provisioners include:
    * installing packages 
    * patching 
    * creating users 
    * downloading application code
    
   
##### Running Packer
Once the file is ready we will need to dothe following steps...

1. **packer validate web-vistors.json** - If properly formatted the file will successfully validate
    * This command will work just fine if all the variables are within the main packer file, but if you want to pass user variables from a different file the command will have an additional flag **packer validate web-vistors.json**

Validate your configuration.

```shell
> packer validate web-vistors.pkr.hcl
```

```shell
> packer build web-vistors.pkr.hcl
```
